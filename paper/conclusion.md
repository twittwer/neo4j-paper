# Conclusion

- no joins needed to achive relationships
- similar structure to other document based dbs --> parallel/synced/hybrid usage possible (mongodb)
- CAP -> CA ( relation oriented -> many side effects, complex queries )
- used by Wallmart (real-time recommandation), Ebay (logistics), LinkedIn (Social Network), TomTom (Geo Routing), !Facebook
- manly relational analytics -> not performant until you have many joins (https://de.slideshare.net/DhavalDalal/neo4j-my-sqlmssqlcomparisonfinal p.19)
- auto index popular nodes by time (http://addisonlee.azurewebsites.net/neo4j-vs-mysql-vs-mongodb/)

=> unique and awesome
