# Neo4j Paper

### Abstract

The purpose of this research is to give a basic overview over graph databases and a closer look at the main principles of Neo4j, since Neo4j is the most popular graph database worldwide.<br>
For a good overview of the database system we analyzed the core concepts of graph databases and Neo4j's specific behavior. We had a look at Neo4j's data structure and their unique query language "cypher". Based on this information we pointed out the advantages and disadvantages, so we can compare Neo4j to other database management systems (SQL and NoSQL). In the end we classify the position of Neo4j in the CAP-theorem, point out poss√≠ble use cases and check the performance.
