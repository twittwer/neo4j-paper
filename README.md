> Main

For a good overview of the database system we analyzed the core concepts of graph databases and Neo4j's specific behavior.
We had a look at Neo4j's data structure and their unique query language "cypher". Based on this information we pointed out their pros and cons, to make an comparison to other DBMS (SQL and NoSQL). In the end we gathered the database respective their CAP-theorem classification, possible use cases and performance.
